MiniBASIC runs within Mini Micro.  If you have downloaded MiniBASIC 
to run on your Windows machine, you should now have a folder with the
following files:

        Mini Micro_Data (folder)
===>    Mini Micro.exe (main application)
        Mono (folder)
        MonoBleedingEdge (folder)
        README-Mac.txt (this file)
        UnityCrashHandler32.exe (executable)
        UnityCrashHandler64.exe (executable)
        UnityPlayer.dll (library file)
        user.minidisk (folder)
        WinPixEventRuntime.dll (library file)

To run MiniBASIC, you will just run Mini Micro.exe inside the
MiniMicro folder.  You should see a virtual computer appear with 
a MiniBASIC prompt.
