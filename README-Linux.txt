WELCOME
-------
MiniBASIC runs within Mini Micro.  If you have downloaded MiniBASIC 
to run on Linux, you should now have a folder with the following
files:

	MiniMicro_Data (folder)
	MiniMicro.x86_64 (executable)
	UnityPlayer.so (library file)
	user.minidisk (folder)
	README-Linux.txt (this file)

To run MiniBASIC, simply run MiniMicro.x86_64.  You should see a
virtual computer appear with a MiniBASIC prompt.
