# Welcome to MiniBASIC

MiniBASIC is a classic BASIC interpreter with these design goals:

1. Compatible with 1980s-era code listings, books, and magazines, including such beautiful and fun gems as the [classic Usborne BASIC Programming Books](https://usborne.com/us/books/computer-and-coding-books).

2. Friendly and easy to use, with features like input history (just press up-arrow!) and modern line-editing.

3. A powerful virtual retro computer, with full-color 960x640 resolution graphics and sound, that runs on any modern desktop machine.

That last design goal is achieved by running MiniBASIC on [Mini Micro](https:miniscript.org/MiniMicro/), a powerful neo-retro virtual computer.  (If you like what you can do in MiniBASIC, you will _love_ what you can do in Mini Micro's native language of [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/)!)
